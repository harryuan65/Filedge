    "- A user can upload and share files,\n",
    "- Sharing links should be hard to guess,\n",
    "- Sharing links will expire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your design should be a brief written explanation of how you would structure this application, including explaining your choices about architecture, stack, etc. You can include basic drawings or diagrams if they are helpful.\n",

    "\n",
    "Implement a web application. You should:\n",
    "- Fulfills the requirements in part 1.\n",
    "- Dockerize the app.\n",
    "- Provide a README with clear setup instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will discuss and expand on your code during the onsite interview. We look for the following qualities in submissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy\n",
    "- Code quality: maintainability, extendability, readability, etc.\n",

    "- A user can upload files -> a user has many files\n",
    "- A user can share files  -> a file might have a sharing link\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sharing links should be hard to guess.\n",
    "  My ideas were:\n",
    "    - We can try solely using a uuid for `user_files#id`. The `user_files#show` will conveniently be our sharing link. Users who know this URL cannot guess the other ids since it is not sequential.\n",
    "    - However, because `GET user_files/UUID_GIBBERISH` is also exposing sensitive info, I think it's better to hide  information when sharing files. So I planned to generate a unique hash and create the link as `/share/UNIQUE_HASH`. I pick `Digest::SHA256` since \n",
    "        - It has tons of possible outputs ($2^{256}$).\n",
    "        - It is known to be very unlikely to create duplicated keys. Even when the input change only slightly, the output will change drastically.\n",
    "  For now, this is my function to generate a random link hash.\n",
    "  $$\\text{digest} = \\text{SHA256}(\\text{ user\\_file\\_id })$$\n",
    "- Sharing links will expire.\n",
    "  - Sharing links will have an `expire_at` field. \n",
    "  - When a user tries to access a link that is expired, he should receive a 404 response.\n",

    "File upload: I want to make \"files\" a single model `UserFile` that can be referenced by a `SharingLink`, So I use `carrierwave` instead of `active storage` for this case. Both of them supports uploading to local storage and S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database choice: The models I planned to create have clear schemas and relationships, so I prefer using a sql database. Selecting `PostgresSQL`  is because I am more familiar with it.\n",
